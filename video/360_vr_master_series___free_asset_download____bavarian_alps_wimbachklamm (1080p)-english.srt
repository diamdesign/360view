00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey there, how's it going?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Not too bad, just hanging out.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Cool, have you seen any good movies lately?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, I watched a really good one last night.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nice, what was it about?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was a thriller about a detective solving a murder mystery.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That sounds intriguing, I'll have to check it out.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Definitely worth watching if you're into suspenseful movies.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll add it to my list, thanks for the recommendation.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No problem, let me know what you think after you watch it.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Will do, catch you later!

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
See you later, have a great day!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hey, do you have any plans for the weekend?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Not yet, I'm still figuring out what to do.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We should go hiking, the weather is supposed to be nice.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That sounds like a great idea, I could use some fresh air.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Awesome, I'll look up some trails and let you know.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sounds like a plan, thanks for organizing!

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No problem, it'll be fun to explore new trails together.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Definitely, can't wait to hit the trails!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's going to be epic, see you then!

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
See you soon, take care!

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, did you hear about the new restaurant downtown?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, I heard it's supposed to be really good.
